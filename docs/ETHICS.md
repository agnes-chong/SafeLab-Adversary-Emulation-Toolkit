# ETHICS & LAB RULES

This repository is intended **only** for educational, research, and purple-team exercises in isolated laboratory environments.

## Mandatory Rules
1. **Run only on systems you own or have written permission to test.**  
2. **Never** point emulation scripts at production systems or other people's machines or networks.  
3. **Do not** collect, store, or expose real credentials or personal data. Use synthetic/demo data only.  
4. **Use snapshots:** snapshot your VM before running tests and revert after experiments.  
5. **No persistence / no credential harvesting:** repository scripts are intentionally benign and must remain so. Do not add keylogging, credential dumping, remote backdoors, or similar offensive capability.  
6. **Follow local laws and institutional policies.** If in doubt, get written authorization.
